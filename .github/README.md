## :coffee: About

This is my personal **dotfiles** setup — a collection of configuration files and scripts that I use to customize and optimize my development environment.

Minimalist, aesthetic, and tailored for productivity.

---

## 🚀 Installation

> ⚠️ Use at your own risk!  
> These dotfiles are highly personal and may override existing configs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fedetomassini/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh (soon)
```

---

Made with :coffee: and a bit of `~/.config` magic ✨
